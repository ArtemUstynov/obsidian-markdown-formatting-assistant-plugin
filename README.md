## Side Panel

The Side Panel can be opened by the Ribbon Icon on the left side. If you changed the side of the panel in the settings, just hit this butten/icon again and it will reload on the right side.

## Command Language

With the command language the speed of the workflow can be specifically improved. By typing the trigger char (by default `\`) the commands will be activated and a suggestion window opens. It shows maximal 5 suggestions, which can be improved by adding more letters. The selected suggestion can be changed with the arrow keys and be activated with the enter key.

## Color Picker

### Select a color

The color picker provides an easy and fast workflow to work with colors. If you pick a color with the `Select a Color` button and leave the window (by clicking outside the color picker), the selected color will be inserted at the current courser position. In addition, it will be copied to the clipboard.

### Color History

Furthermore, the color picker saves the history of the last 10 used colors.

### Saved Colors

To Save the current color even if obsidian will be closed, just click the `Save Color` button.

### Sort saved Colors

All saved colors can be sorted via drop a catch.

### Delete a Color

To delete a saved or last used color just click it with the right mouse button.
